# Shipping Tracking UI
The ShippingTracking UI component is a reusable Swift UI element designed in **UIKIT** to visually represent the **progress of a shipment or order journey**. It shows a list of tracking events in a vertical timeline format, allowing users to easily view the current status and history of their shipments. The component includes a series of events, each with an icon, title, date, and ... details, connected by a dotted line to indicate sequential progression.
